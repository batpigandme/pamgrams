```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = 'fig/', dev = 'png', dpi = 100, fig.retina = 2)
```

```{r load libs, message=FALSE}

Let's read in the Pam-bigram data.

```{r read pamgrams, message=FALSE}
## read csv file
pam_bigrams <- read_csv("data/pam_bigrams.csv")
```

Now we'll use the `sample_n()` function from `dplyr` to get 15 (though you could use any number) observations/rows from our pamgram data. Note that the `freq` variable contains the number of times a given bigram occurred in the "PAM" corpus (which, as of this writing, includes all of Archer, seasons 1 - 7).

```{r sample pamgrams}
sample_n(pam_bigrams, 15)
```
