13354,"PAM"," You just -- oh whatever, c'mon, we gotta figure a way out of this!"
13402,"PAM"," That's what Dad said, when the bank man came out to foreclose on the farm. And guess how that turned out."
13404,"PAM"," No, we got a loan modification. You think a bank wants to own a failing dairy farm? With obsolete milkers? Oh my God, speaking of..."
13407,"PAM"," Man, I hope not..."
13409,"PAM"," Guess not."
13412,"PAM"," Don't get me wrong, I'd still do her."

14077,"PAM"," Yeah, that lemur is hosed."
14196,"PAM"," Well this is a frickin disaster!"
14198,"PAM"," No. Nobody's doing their peer reviews!"
14200,"PAM"," It matters to me!"
14202,"PAM"," Well then maybe instead of doing my job I'll go hang out in Vermont with Luke Troy and all the other assholes!"
14204,"PAM"," Oops."
14208,"PAM"," So why are these damn peer reviews so hard?! Only like ten people work in this whole goddamn chickenshit outfit! Sorry."

16421,"PAM"," That's what she was screamin at you. Okay, so I watched the whole thing."
16423,"PAM"," No. I just slept out there a lot."

17808,"PAM"," Edie, yes, shut up, and when we were kids she was so mean to me? Always teasing me, calling me Spamela, rubbing cheese curds in my eyes? One time she stabbed me in the neck?"
17810,"PAM"," Ha ha ha, hell no, I wouldn't piss on her neck-stabbin ass if it was on fire."
17822,"PAM"," I got some Kentucky Moon in my -"

18186,"PAM"," You shut up. Let her talk."
18188,"PAM"," Make me!"
18209,"PAM"," Oh, and throw a bone into me."
18215,"PAM"," There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS."
18219,"PAM"," And this whole other thing with the Yakuza."
18223,"PAM"," No, actual piracy. With, like, boats."
18229,"PAM"," Kidnapping the Pope..."
18231,"PAM"," Bumfights! You know, like when you pay bums to..."
18239,"PAM"," Which time? 'Cause for one of 'em I got a pretty good excuse."
18241,"PAM"," That's what he said. Ahem. Inappropriate."
18281,"PAM"," ""That the facts herein are true and correct, signed Pamela Poovey."""
18286,"PAM"," And I believe there was some mention of throwing a bone into me?"
18288,"PAM"," A penis in my vagina. Or wherever, but come on, chop-chop, I got to go start enjoying my immunity."
18298,"PAM"," Aw, but look at him. All tied up like a sexy little Christmas ham."
18302,"PAM"," Hello, best part."
18338,"PAM"," As what? An actual acorn?"

18518,"PAM"," He's okay! He's okay don't come in here don't come in here he's okay!"
18520,"PAM"," What, I said don't come in here!"
18523,"PAM"," Really, so this super-judgy feeling I'm feeling is just me feeling like you're super-judgy and that's me?!"
18525,"PAM"," Are you shitting me? I can't hear anything over my har -- tbeat, yerp, fired back up boop!"
18527,"PAM"," Oh okay so I should take life advice from an unwed mother?! With a dirty car?!"
18528,"PAM"," Is he dead?"
18530,"PAM"," He looks dead."
18532,"PAM"," I think he's dead."
18536,"PAM"," Is he a zombie?"
18546,"PAM"," So we could unfreeze you in the future, once medical science had developed a cure for... head-smash."
18574,"PAM"," Right?"
18580,"PAM"," Kachoooo!"
18582,"PAM"," I know."
18605,"PAM"," It's not that bad! I mean it's not great, but... This is still some primo shit."

18771,"PAM"," Or three, or whatever."
18773,"PAM"," Make me!"
18785,"PAM"," Like a big bag of cocaine!"
18787,"PAM"," Disagree."
18789,"PAM"," Your words."
18800,"PAM"," Have you tried cocaine?"
18819,"PAM"," Scrooge McDuck, eh? [COUGHS] Sweater."
18841,"PAM"," Welp! I've got good news and good news."
18843,"PAM"," Right? And I know it sounds crazy, but I like them as much as cocaine."
18845,"PAM"," Okay, okay, okay, so remember how I used to drift-race with the Yakuza?"
18847,"PAM"," Hai."
18849,"PAM"," Busy being pussies. You know, relatively. When compared to the deadly and terrible Yakuza."
18851,"PAM"," Oh, my God, right? Can you imagine?"
18855,"PAM"," Um... Well, they know I work at ISIS, but that won't do them any good."
18857,"PAM"," Although..."
18858,"PAM"," Whooooo! Domo arigato, fellas. Two of them have been to my apartment. You, too, Ojiisan. Or three, or whatever."
18860,"PAM"," But now I live here, so..."
18862,"PAM"," Although..."
18866,"PAM"," I'm not here."
18874,"PAM"," No!"
18876,"PAM"," Make me! [SOBBING] Holy shitsnacks."
18881,"PAM"," [CLEARS THROAT] Hello?"

18885,"PAM"," Hey, you know what? Don't even sweat it, because... Hmm? Hai. Hai. Hai. Mm-kay, bye. [*** Pam hangs up phone call with Mr Moto ***]"
18888,"PAM"," Well, he's not happy, obviously, and he wants his drugs back, and that guy who sold 'em to me's not gonna be playing the violin any time soon."
18890,"PAM"," Because a violin would probably dissolve in the same big drum of acid they dissolved that guy in."
18906,"PAM"," [SOBBING]"
18908,"PAM"," Moto doesn't just want the pills...! He also wants my heh-heh-heh-head! Non-metaph-phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh-"

18971,"PAM"," [LAUGHS] Talk about a floor model. Oh, come on, we were all thinking it."
18992,"PAM"," So why'd he build a bunch of tunnels?"
18994,"PAM"," Wow."
19006,"PAM"," Why do I have to carry him?"
19008,"PAM"," Just asking."
19017,"PAM"," Aw, quit your literal bellyaching."
19027,"PAM"," Okay! Sorry! I'm walking backwards here."
19085,"PAM"," I thought they were cocks."
19100,"PAM"," Or the inspiring story of her heroic struggle to finally triumph over it?"
19102,"PAM"," Yogurt!"
19104,"PAM"," Hey!"

19283,"PAM"," [GROWLS]"
19358,"PAM"," Need... got to... More cocaine."
19392,"PAM"," Aw, crap."
19476,"PAM"," Cyril choke-banged you on a blimp? Oh, come on, we were all thinking it."
19525,"PAM"," [LAUGHING]"
19549,"PAM"," [LAUGHING] Ouch!"
19551,"PAM"," Seriously though, I'm sorry you heard her say that. That's got to be a real knee to the old emotional nut sack."
19553,"PAM"," Eh."
19555,"PAM"," What?!"
19557,"PAM"," Holy dickburn! So you got a buyer lined up in Texas and everything?!"
19559,"PAM"," Yeah, but not 100 pounds."
19561,"PAM"," Wonder if there's a statewide database of towns with sucky high school football teams cross-indexed with towns a black person just moved to."
19563,"PAM"," [LAUGHS] Duh, me too, lickbag."
19565,"PAM"," Um, so, hey, speaking of..."
19567,"PAM"," Right?"
19579,"PAM"," Woooooo!! [LAUGHS]"
19581,"PAM"," Hey, sleepyhead! Welcome to Texas!"
19583,"PAM"," That's how we do backseat drivers."
19585,"PAM"," Yeah, and sucking at it."
19587,"PAM"," Like, 12 hours? Five states, dozen cupcakes, a bunch of truck stops."
19589,"PAM"," Hang on."
19591,"PAM"," Who?"
19593,"PAM"," Cupcakes? Oh! [LAUGHS] Oh, no."
19595,"PAM"," Truck stops... are crazy awesome! This is Snowball, good buddy."
19598,"PAM"," Wha...? No, lickbag!"
19600,"PAM"," What the...?"
19615,"PAM"," Uh... mm... maybe."
19617,"PAM"," Or definitely. Or whatever."
19619,"PAM"," I wanted people to like me."
19621,"PAM"," It's not just a shower, it's more communal, like a Japanese onsen, or..."
19623,"PAM"," What the heck are you looking for?"
19628,"PAM"," They're shooting at them!"
19630,"PAM"," Huh."
19641,"PAM"," Are you, like, sure you brought it?"
19646,"PAM"," Okay, so, apparently a big thing at truck stops is a game called craps. And apparently I'm not good at it."
19652,"PAM"," You mad?"
19654,"PAM"," No? No? No?"
19656,"PAM"," Aw, come on, Archer, don't do that! That's not what good buddies do!"
19660,"PAM"," Yeah, you're one to talk."
19664,"PAM"," Oh, come on, please?"
19671,"PAM"," What?! I mean, that's just absolutely crazy. We have nothing."
19677,"PAM"," Yeah, you guys chill on the bus. I'll help lickbag here change the tire."
19679,"PAM"," Sorry, I had to sell it. Chop-chop! Get the lead out, lickbag!"
19681,"PAM"," [LAUGHING] It's your CB handle! I told it to everybody from here to Kentucky! Good buddy."
19688,"PAM"," Yeah, whatcha waiting for, lickbag?"
19689,"PAM"," Ten-four."
19693,"PAM"," Yay!"
19695,"PAM"," Boo."
19702,"PAM"," In this shit-heap? Are you nuts?!"
19710,"PAM"," They don't have the coke, lickbag! We do! Right here in the Trans Am!"
19713,"PAM"," I switched the coke in Little Rock, 'cause I was worried that..."
19715,"PAM"," Does the why really matter?"
19717,"PAM"," Yeah! Check it out, lick bag! Cherlene wrote a song about us."
19719,"PAM"," Oww! What the shit, Snidely Whiplash?!"
19721,"PAM"," Oh, my God, I can't feel my face!"
19723,"PAM"," Well, it's a small price to pay for beauty!"
19725,"PAM"," Man, and here you are without your gun. That's pretty ironic, huh?"
19727,"PAM"," Oh. Okay, so then what's satire?"
19729,"PAM"," Yes, duh. Look, how hot am I now? Let me answer that for you. As balls. That's why everybody likes me now."
19731,"PAM",", Well, and the snowballs, but..."
19733,"PAM"," Really?"
19735,"PAM"," Yeah, with ginormous big tittays."
19737,"PAM"," Aw, you want to bang me? [GUNSHOT]"
19739,"PAM"," Prison? But it's my first offense."
19741,"PAM"," Wait a minute, we're in Travis county. Why does their car say Brazos county?"
19743,"PAM"," Crooked cops?"
19745,"PAM"," Hang on, I still got two..."
19747,"PAM"," Yeah! Holy coke snacks. Enable the shit out of me!"
19749,"PAM"," Well, I don't want to shoot it. That seems like a pretty slippery slope!"
19751,"PAM"," Hang on, I heard it was nicotine."
19753,"PAM"," Yeah, but not overall, is what I'm..."
19755,"PAM"," Of the car?"
19757,"PAM"," Jeez, okay! But you're gonna owe me!"
19759,"PAM"," I believe there was some mention of bone-throwing?"
19786,"PAM"," Well, except for..."
19788,"PAM"," Oh, right. But what about the hundred pounds of coke you dumped on the highway?"
19800,"PAM"," The light takes on a special quality."
19806,"PAM"," Goddamn it."
19831,"PAM"," Krieger!"
19842,"PAM"," Aw, come on! I got to load up my body before Krieger sells it all!"
19845,"PAM"," Krieger's selling the cocaine online."
19857,"PAM"," Ew."
19868,"PAM"," Um..."
19874,"PAM"," Hey!"
19876,"PAM"," [FARTS]"
19880,"PAM"," I think that's bachelorette parties."
19884,"PAM"," Wait, so if Woodhouse is getting everything we need for the party, then..."
19886,"PAM"," Goddamn it."
19888,"PAM"," What?!"
19893,"PAM"," Because it kind of seems like this is about you and not really about Lana."
19895,"PAM"," Really?"
19901,"PAM"," Hey, I appreciate you're just doing your job, but if Kenny doesn't get this embroidered hippie shirt and these gigantic bell-bottoms, I highly doubt you'll have a job tomorrow."
19903,"PAM"," Now, was that so hard... neck nuts?"
19905,"PAM"," Man, you got to miss it. What a rush!"
19907,"PAM"," [LAUGHS] Yeah. It's not like he's Messina."
19909,"PAM"," Sorry! Geez!"
19911,"PAM"," Could I just follow Kenny Loggins?"
19922,"PAM"," [SCREAMS]"
19924,"PAM"," Wait! No, no, no, no!"
19928,"PAM"," Holy shit zaps! Are you okay?"
19931,"PAM"," Meh."
19933,"PAM"," Oh, man, I was like, ""What?!"" So, what's up? What's the plan?"
19958,"PAM"," So, I'm curious-- why didn't you just call Cherlene, who owns the hotel?"
19960,"PAM"," You said shut up, J. Alfred Gotrocks."
19962,"PAM"," We haven't been paid in forever. Where are you getting all this money?"
19966,"PAM"," Hang on, let me grab a name tag."
19968,"PAM"," It's pretty close to Ruby."
19970,"PAM"," Well, why do..."
19972,"PAM"," Dude, they're cocaine."
19974,"PAM"," [LAUGHS] Right?"
19976,"PAM"," Okay."
19978,"PAM"," Housekeeping!"
19980,"PAM"," Prostitute!"
19982,"PAM"," Besides my face hurts?"
19996,"PAM"," And, that being said, I am open to blow jobs for money. I only got eight bucks on me, but..."
20006,"PAM"," Yeah, Ricky."
20008,"PAM"," Oh, yeah."
20010,"PAM"," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
20012,"PAM"," First see if he wants a beej."
20014,"PAM"," Okay!"
20037,"PAM"," Aah!"
20053,"PAM"," A beej!"
20066,"PAM"," It's cocaine!"
20068,"PAM"," This big bastard."
20088,"PAM"," Yay!"
20121,"PAM"," Yam! Yom! Yom!"
20123,"PAM"," Yah! Huh! Yum! Yum! Yum!"
20125,"PAM"," Yum-yum-yum! Yum-yum-yum! Gimme! Gimme! Yum-yum! Gimme!"
20127,"PAM"," Wow."
20129,"PAM"," Wow."
20131,"PAM"," Mm, cocaine enthusiast?"
20135,"PAM"," Wait-- college?"
20142,"PAM"," Aw..."
20148,"PAM"," Ow! Ow! Ow!"
20153,"PAM"," I don't know. Did you?"
20155,"PAM"," Wha...? No! You think, if I had 100 pounds of coke, I'd be sitting here playing choo-choo-spoon with a tranny?"
20159,"PAM"," I'm not! About this!"
20239,"PAM"," Snacklesnamps is awesome. Look, here's some cocaine puddin; here's some more cocaine puddin. Ooh, cocaine puddin."
20242,"PAM"," Yeah, everybody hates it."
20490,"PAM"," It has a simple elegance."
20493,"PAM"," Yaaaayyyyy!"
20500,"PAM"," Aw."
20510,"PAM"," Hey, speaking of rope..."
20512,"PAM"," Yay!"
20552,"PAM"," I'm with you, Lana. It freaked me out seeing her cry like that. It was like seeing my dad cry."
20554,"PAM"," Name it. He's a gigantic pussy. Oh, my God, when my mom died? Hey, and speaking of pussies..."
20556,"PAM"," Yeah, this is a Long Island."
20559,"PAM"," Archer and money and liquor."
20562,"PAM"," You know what always cheers me up..."
20564,"PAM"," I was gonna say cock."
20569,"PAM"," Hmm. I don't know if I'd be comfortable with that. I mean, even for me, it's..."
20571,"PAM"," Getting shitty drunk on two different kinds of liquor, dressing up like Mr. Archer, and banging the old lady with a strap... Ow!"
20573,"PAM"," Okay, good, 'cause the the dressing up like Mr. Archer part makes it kind of weird."
20575,"PAM"," I'd have to be super drunk, like so drunk I bet I wouldn't even enjoy...! Ow! Okay, so what's your plan?"
20598,"PAM"," Yay!"
20643,"PAM"," Aw."
20648,"PAM"," Yeah, when was that?"
20652,"PAM"," Phew!"
20654,"PAM"," What? You had sex with me!"
20657,"PAM"," What are you laughing at?"
20706,"PAM"," Aw, look, she's almost not terrifying."
20712,"PAM"," So... you think those guys are okay?"
20788,"PAM"," It's actually whipped cocaine, so..."
20794,"PAM"," Perfect for what? Come on, it's an album cover, not a... Amish Bible! You got to sex that shit up sexy."
20797,"PAM"," You think that's sexy? With the rocket pops... outside of you."
20800,"PAM"," Yeah, not talking about eating them."
20802,"PAM"," Well, for starters. But let's not rule anything out. You know? Let's kind of see where that leads. We've got a shitload of film."
20805,"PAM"," Krieger!"
20807,"PAM"," The butthole, Lana, is what I was..."
20809,"PAM"," I do."
20811,"PAM"," Yes."
20818,"PAM"," You obviously don't. And it's not that we don't appreciate criticism. It just needs to be constructive."
20946,"PAM"," Ask him what, how to get AIDS?"
21008,"PAM"," Aww."
21026,"PAM"," Aww."
21031,"PAM"," Cows. Bees. Hang on. Bees."
21035,"PAM"," Aww."
21040,"PAM"," Yeah, right."
21058,"PAM"," Dude, your balls are made of pussy."
21084,"PAM"," You mean it's all gone?"
21086,"PAM"," Why?"
21116,"PAM"," Huh?"
21121,"PAM"," Nice."
21163,"PAM"," Shh! Will you shut up?"
21165,"PAM"," She will if you don't shut up."
21167,"PAM"," No, we're not. But if we are, which I don't admit to, which Breakfast Clubber am I?"
21169,"PAM"," Aw."
21171,"PAM"," So, can we get out of the crate now?"
21186,"PAM"," [GROWLS]"
21243,"PAM"," I'm fine, too, by the way."
21255,"PAM"," Holy dickballs! I mean, I mean, I mean, just holy...."
21281,"PAM"," Who are you, Princess... hang on... Lana?"
21283,"PAM"," I've got crate lag."
21285,"PAM"," Ice machine."
21288,"PAM"," Yep!"
21290,"PAM"," Nope!"
21316,"PAM"," What a frickin' clip joint."
21318,"PAM"," No ice machine."
21320,"PAM"," Yeah, right?"
21324,"PAM"," Do...?"
21326,"PAM"," Sometimes I worry about her."
21329,"PAM"," I don't know. It looks kind of..."
21332,"PAM"," Oh, my God, please say yes."
21389,"PAM"," Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man..."
21394,"PAM"," Huh-uh. Ow, hang on..."
21396,"PAM"," Clones!"
21403,"PAM"," Wait, what? I thought we were running away from them!"
21406,"PAM"," Not without a bunch of garlic and some wooden stakes."
21408,"PAM"," It doesn't matter to the stake!"
21410,"PAM"," Well, not now. We wait till morning and then murder them in their coffins. Cyril? Thoughts?"
21456,"PAM"," Hear, hear!"
21458,"PAM"," And plus that one right there."
21479,"PAM"," So we can scrooch down behind it."
21481,"PAM"," Oh, did you just say that?"
21515,"PAM"," Jinx."
21517,"PAM"," Inappropes."
21535,"PAM"," Stayin' alive. [LAUGHING] Holy shit, that works."
21539,"PAM"," What, did you just want mouth-to-mouth?"
21551,"PAM"," And not the good kind you get drunk with at Myrtle Beach and cruise the strip in the bed of their monster truck with a big rebel flag on it, flinging empty longnecks at people."
21553,"PAM"," Now who's racist?"
21555,"PAM"," Oh. Well now I feel like an asshole."
21557,"PAM"," Almost always. I really like me."
21585,"PAM"," Yay!"
21598,"PAM"," Wait, what about Krieger?"
21602,"PAM"," Plus, I bet the vampires got him."
21672,"PAM"," What, were you not gonna say stairs?"
21675,"PAM"," Ouch."
21679,"PAM"," Seriously."
21716,"PAM"," No....!"
21730,"PAM"," Yeah, that's some messed-up shit."
21734,"PAM"," 'Cause I'm not a pussy? And also probably 'cause of this."
21736,"PAM"," Yep."
21739,"PAM"," Oh, good. 'Cause for a second there, I thought I actually was a pussy."
21758,"PAM"," Weddings always get me."
21788,"PAM"," Cyril?"
21800,"PAM"," Mike Ducockless! Oh, boy. Ha, ha!"
21857,"PAM"," What are you, nuts? Cap'n Crunch here just took all the coca fields back from the rebels. We're sitting on an endless supply."
21859,"PAM"," [GULPING]"
21862,"PAM"," 'Cause that's just empty calories."
21864,"PAM"," Which, if I'm being totally honest, I maybe might have a problem with."
21875,"PAM"," Wait, they got weed here, too?"
21885,"PAM"," Then he shuts off the tractor beam, releasing the Jews from captivity."
21960,"PAM"," Yay!"
21963,"PAM"," Yet! Inappropes."
21965,"PAM"," I'm trying to make that a thing people say, like, ""Damn, dawg, that's inappropes!"" Plus, I think I'm addicted to cocaine."
21967,"PAM"," Damn, dawg..."
21969,"PAM"," Yay!"
22049,"PAM"," Mind if I cut in?"
22052,"PAM"," Screw you guys. Hey, Krieger!"
22054,"PAM"," Cyril's the new dictator..."
22056,"PAM"," Shut up, and he just married crazy tits, and I need a dance partner."
22061,"PAM"," We figured the vampires ate you."
22068,"PAM"," If he even is Krieger!"
22071,"PAM"," The real Krieger could be down there!"
22075,"PAM"," Uh-huh."
22078,"PAM"," He sounds like a vampire! I say we tie him up and let the sun sort it out!"
22082,"PAM"," What is going on?"
22084,"PAM"," Or should we say Count Krieg... Ow! Ow! Ow, cut it out! Ow! Goddamn it! Ow!"
22086,"PAM"," Vampire lovers."
22103,"PAM"," Yay!"
22113,"PAM"," Can't, or won't?"
22115,"PAM"," Oh. I didn't hear you."
22127,"PAM"," Doppelkriegers."
22129,"PAM"," Ooh, and Cherlene!"
22134,"PAM"," But the note says not..."
22285,"PAM"," Mm, mm. Wouldn't bullion leak out of a...? Ow! Ow! Cut it... Ow, goddamn it! I... Ow!"
22287,"PAM"," I don't know what that is!"
22290,"PAM"," [CACKLING]"
22292,"PAM"," You said you've seen cooze. Inappropes."
22345,"PAM"," Because these trunks feel light. Do you swear they're full of cocaine?"
22347,"PAM"," God hates you. Open 'em up."
22350,"PAM"," On what?"
22354,"PAM"," You heard her, Cyril-- that is legally binding."
22387,"PAM"," Yeah, and then drag him out of the car and kneel him down and shoot him in the back of the head and string him up on a lamppost like Mussolini!"
22390,"PAM"," Me too."
22392,"PAM"," Cyril...!"
22418,"PAM"," You know how many times I've helped a cow give birth in the barn? Plus, one time, my sister Edie? Well, she couldn't have it in the house. Long story. A long, racist story."
22430,"PAM"," Hey! I have the correct number of hands, but they're currently kind of full and you need a slappin', so..."
22434,"PAM"," Okay, okay, okay. Get some hay ready to dry this little bastard off because now you are gonna push!"
22436,"PAM"," You old bitch! Now move that big fat smelly ass, you hear? A Day No Pigs Would Die? Anybody? Not a big Robert Newton Peck crowd, huh?"
22438,"PAM"," Oh, shut up. Now push!"
22444,"PAM"," Well, it's a girl!"
22446,"PAM"," And whoever had black guy, pay up."
22449,"PAM"," Yep. Got ourselves a little quadroon."
22470,"PAM"," [GASPS] You think she's buying more coke?"
22475,"PAM"," What?"
22590,"PAM"," Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh my God! Are you guys so frickin' excited?"
22608,"PAM"," No, the other one was just a hologram."
22614,"PAM"," Oh, that's probably just Milton."
22650,"PAM"," And some of which merely resembled it."
22674,"PAM"," I'll catch up, I gotta run in here real quick and grab some urinal cakes."
22676,"PAM"," For my shower at home."
22679,"PAM"," Ms. Archer looks like a mule kicked her in the face. How's the water?"
22681,"PAM"," Pam."
22683,"PAM"," So I gained the weight back. Sue me."
22685,"PAM"," Look, my therapist says everybody's got a hole that needs to be filled. Some people fill it with drugs, some fill it with work, some fill it with between-meal snacks and liquor and their therapist's cock."
22687,"PAM"," Oh, yeah. It's a lightning bolt, but I guess the letters could use a touch-up. It's supposed to say ""TCB."" ""Takin' care of beaveness."""
22929,"PAM"," Hey! Is it too much to ask, during the goddamn work day, for two separate sessions of 80 uninterrupted minutes each of quality dump time?"
22932,"PAM"," I thought so, yeah. So I'll pass that on to who or whomever asked."
22937,"PAM"," Oh, thank God!"
22940,"PAM"," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on! I'm sure-- wait. Did you murder the baby?"
22942,"PAM"," No, but like ""swearsie-realsies""?"
22944,"PAM"," And that's pretty sacred to us, so... we'll go help you look for baby A.J. In, like, five-teen, 40 minutes."
22958,"PAM"," Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her. Now just try to retrace your steps."
22963,"PAM"," It is kinda hard to tell with you."
23023,"PAM"," Oh, my God!"
23026,"PAM"," Seriously?"
23035,"PAM"," How creepy!"
23040,"PAM"," I'm not saying nothing."
23201,"PAM"," Ya find it?"
23214,"PAM"," Mmblello?"
23216,"PAM"," I am? Aw, maaan..."
23218,"PAM"," Yaagh!"
23244,"PAM"," Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hang on, I got a key, ya skimpnuts."
23248,"PAM"," Open marriage."
23252,"PAM"," Don't worry about it."
23254,"PAM"," Looks like Pam's lucky night... because of the snacks, ya dickholes! Although..."
23269,"PAM"," No, nothing. Wh-?"
23271,"PAM"," Ew!"
23276,"PAM"," And literally the most fattening thing in the entire goddamn fridge. No wonder she's so frickin skinny. Everything else is in plastic bags."
23278,"PAM"," Don't worry about it."
23330,"PAM"," I would if I had the strength, dick!"
23404,"PAM"," My-my-my-my--"
23406,"PAM"," My-my-my-my-- sis-sis-sis-sis--"
23408,"PAM"," Ow! God dammit, dude."
23410,"PAM"," My sister Edie is getting married to Don Ekblad, Jr. of all people, and she asked me to be a bridesmaid."
23412,"PAM"," I should be maid of honor, dicknuts, but no, guess who she asks instead?"
23414,"PAM"," Midge Olerud!"
23416,"PAM"," Yes. Midge ""Hey Edie, ""let's me and you blow Pam's boyfriend Arn behind the goddamn grain elevator"" Olerud!"
23418,"PAM"," Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--"
23420,"PAM"," Okay, Jesus. Calm down, Ike Turner.I don't want to show up with a black eye."
23422,"PAM"," Eye, idiot, eye. Although, no. Not a lot of black guys in rural Wisconsin. And, I don't want to sound racist, but--"
23424,"PAM"," A black guy would be better than no date, which is what I'm taking now."
23426,"PAM"," Saturday. Day after tomorrow."
23428,"PAM"," Really? Really, really, really?"
23430,"PAM"," Oh, man. Wait till they see-- Wait, that's how you ask a woman out?"
23433,"PAM"," Yes you do. Shut up. You're Gordon Shumway, and you own a 500-acre dairy farm in upstate New York, with 600 Holsteins and two Herringbone milking parlors."
23435,"PAM"," Oh, yeah."
23437,"PAM"," Come on, Archer, that's us. Flight 934, to Greenbay, Wisconsin."
23470,"PAM"," By dressing like a maitre D' on a dinner cruise for gay Republicans?"
23472,"PAM"," I don't know, but you don't want Edie dogging you out in front of the entire school."
23474,"PAM"," Rehearsal dinner. Shut up."
23476,"PAM"," No, not pig's blood."
23478,"PAM"," Really?"
23480,"PAM"," Shit-ass. But you've got to pace me, I'm sewn into this sumbitch. So for every ounce that goes in, an ounce gotta go out."
23482,"PAM"," And laxatives... there's a sundae bar."
23488,"PAM"," And you will be civil and polite. And you will not let her push your--"
23497,"PAM"," God dammit! Let me go!"
23501,"PAM"," God dammit! Happy?"
23505,"PAM"," Told ya, it's that jacket."
23508,"PAM"," Okay, you know what?"
23510,"PAM"," I-- Ah! I am out of here. Pam, wait!"
23513,"PAM"," Stupid, frickin' Edie. I'll show her what Arn's balls taste like. Wait, what the? Barry?"
23546,"PAM"," Your worst frickin' nightmare."
23584,"PAM"," So you're just bug-nuts crazy, huh?"
23588,"PAM"," Uh, why did you tell me that?"
23609,"PAM"," Told ya!"
23613,"PAM"," Yeah, and just a heads up--"
23617,"PAM"," Edie, cut me down!"
23621,"PAM"," I meant cut me down from here!"
23626,"PAM"," Archer! Do something!"
23628,"PAM"," Ow. Hey, track suit, if anybody's gonna choke my sister's bitch neck, it's gonna be me."
23633,"PAM"," Shut up! Huh, I mean, I'm not a doctor, or, a robotisist, but, uh, that can't be good. So, hey, why don't we all do this--"
23636,"PAM"," So, thank you..."
23638,"PAM"," Saving your life?"
23640,"PAM"," So, you really think he's dead?"
23649,"PAM"," Yes. All I wanted."
23650,"PAM"," Jeez, LaRue, can you believe this? A mandatory meeting at 7 A.M.? Wonder what crawled up her butt."
23653,"PAM"," About the staff meeting?"
23660,"PAM"," Hurry up, ya ding-dongs!"
23662,"PAM"," Hurry up."
23665,"PAM"," One step ahead of you. Or am I?"
23678,"PAM"," Ugh! That was a figure of speech."
23688,"PAM"," What?"
23712,"PAM"," Hello!"
23747,"PAM"," Yeah, mine at home gets bad sticky."
23770,"PAM"," Get your own goddamn bear claw!"
23799,"PAM"," Why would you tell us that story?"
23804,"PAM"," Yeah, give it up, weakie. Pam, shut up. I'll start. Here's...maybe six ounces of Bourbon. If Cyril would hurry it up already! For the love of God, will you just--"
23812,"PAM"," Plus the food'll just fall out the neckhole."
23822,"PAM"," Me too."
23827,"PAM"," A quart? This a fawty, shawty!"
23844,"PAM"," Linguine and clam sauce."
23847,"PAM"," But I don't know about those clams, though."
23849,"PAM"," I have to pee."
23853,"PAM"," Well, I'm not a frickin' mind reader."
23855,"PAM"," Yeah."
23878,"PAM"," So Cyril ought to be able to jack it."
23880,"PAM"," Well, we tried."
23889,"PAM"," Psst, Cyril. Try to rub one out."
23891,"PAM"," Oh, for-- Not even watching that?"
23905,"PAM"," No. That works. I've heard about people doing that."
23907,"PAM"," I don't need an excuse."
23922,"PAM"," No, but at the last second, you just jump up in the air."
23924,"PAM"," Because you'd give me a lecture on it."
23941,"PAM"," Boom! Priapism!"
23944,"PAM"," Like meat at a Brazilian steakhouse!"
23948,"PAM"," Both."
23956,"PAM"," Well, then I'm peeing."
23958,"PAM"," I think I can get it all back in here."
23963,"PAM"," Let it go."
23972,"PAM"," I thought the hole was bigger."
23988,"PAM"," Okay! Jeez!"
23990,"PAM"," What? Serious shit, did red dawn happen and nobody told me about it?"
23992,"PAM"," There! Happy?"
24005,"PAM"," In Soviet Russia--"
24007,"PAM"," --Toaster take picture of you."
24016,"PAM"," In Soviet Russia--"
24032,"PAM"," Oh, Jesus!"
24042,"PAM"," 911 burn!"
24058,"PAM"," Yeah, inappropes!"
24060,"PAM"," Oh, please. You've all seen it!"
24073,"PAM"," Again?"

24292,"PAM"," I'm a notary!"
24295,"PAM"," What the shit, Manny?"
24302,"PAM"," Wait, what the hell am I doing? The roof's the first place they'll look."
24376,"PAM"," They weren't solid."
24403,"PAM"," So... you do improv, huh?"
24407,"PAM"," Goddamn, who is it? Cancer?"
24410,"PAM"," And that's how you ask?"
24412,"PAM"," Yes."
24419,"PAM"," Hang on! Make him beg!"
24423,"PAM"," How did you get on the no-fly list? Uh..."
24434,"PAM"," Yay!"
24443,"PAM"," And me and Krieger are all about going to Branson!"
24448,"PAM"," It's only the biggest country music tourist destination in the world!"
24451,"PAM"," She has no memory of any of that."
24455,"PAM"," the comedy stylings of Yakov Smirnoff!"
24458,"PAM"," Are you serious?"
24467,"PAM"," Wait, what?"
24471,"PAM"," Man, I can't see it!"
24473,"PAM"," What's Area-- Are you shitting me? Everybody knows about Area 51!"

24635,"PAM"," Yeah, like just a fire drill."
24637,"PAM"," You don't think I killed him, do ya?"
24666,"PAM"," Pff, like what, how to build a better anal probe?"
24668,"PAM"," A light-year's a unit of length, dipshit."
24670,"PAM"," Length."
24672,"PAM"," I know how far light travels in vacuum in a Julian year."
24674,"PAM"," I, that, my, I-- you know my name? Yes, Pamela."

24985,"PAM"," What? Yes, you ding-dongs! Throw out the goddamn bowling balls!"
24987,"PAM"," And that's how they all died."
25012,"PAM"," Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Please, don't-- Darryl?"
25014,"PAM"," Oh, my God, I used to beat this bitch's ass at fight club, like, all the time!"
25018,"PAM"," Long story, funny story, and I'll tell you guys all about it over beers at the nearest titty bar, my treat."
25020,"PAM"," No, but Beard McBoggeyes over there will and he'll install a nitrous tank, so you don't have to drive around town like a giant pussy. Won't ya, Krieger?"
25022,"PAM"," So c'mon, let's go make it rain Pammy."
25024,"PAM"," Honestly don't care."
25065,"PAM"," Holy shit."
25104,"PAM"," I think these uniforms are awesome! Here, let me get some pics of you!"
25106,"PAM"," Pfff, please. Please?"
25127,"PAM"," Ow!"
25133,"PAM"," Burn!"
25138,"PAM"," What?"
25142,"PAM"," Ow, man, what a hate-slappin' bitch."
25144,"PAM"," Wait, what? But I thought you and Lana were kinda, you know..."
25146,"PAM"," Well, nothing, but--"
25148,"PAM"," So what, you're gonna try to bang the queen just to make Lana jealous?"
25150,"PAM"," Your mom's dog?"
25152,"PAM"," The wife of a duke?"
25154,"PAM"," Moaning Lisa."
25156,"PAM"," Girl with a pearl necklace. The potato eaters."
25158,"PAM"," But wait. Why are you telling me your plan to not make Lana jealous?"
25160,"PAM"," You're my best friend!"
25162,"PAM"," You're my second best friend! Oh, my God..."
25164,"PAM"," Eh, I thought by now I'd be doing a lot better in the old friend department."
25166,"PAM"," Well, day's not over..."
25198,"PAM"," 10-4 on the 20, come back."
25218,"PAM"," And I am embarrassed to say that I have room for only one passenger."
25220,"PAM"," Burn."
25222,"PAM"," Return! I shall take His Highness, and then I shall speedily return for--"
25226,"PAM"," Damn, Gina."
25230,"PAM"," Pardon, but I'm supposed to--"
25236,"PAM"," Blorp."
25290,"PAM"," I'll be seein' you two later..."
25296,"PAM"," Yeah, they are gonna kill everybody."
25299,"PAM"," Yeah, Lana, get his pants off."
25319,"PAM"," Ew."
25323,"PAM"," Wait, what about you guys?"
25327,"PAM"," Uh-huh."
25372,"PAM"," Well, we were all thinkin' it."
25375,"PAM"," Oh, then Ray's right."
25377,"PAM"," Well, hooray. Give yourself a hand."
25379,"PAM"," I know you better sit your ass down before I slam an Easy Spirit up it."
25382,"PAM"," They make me sick! Rub it in our faces how we're doomed to be alone."
25385,"PAM"," Yeah, that's her point. And think how hard watching them must be for Cyril."
25387,"PAM"," Cyril! You can lie to yourself..."
25389,"PAM"," ...but don't lie to Team Breakup. Uh what? Guys, it's obvious what we gotta do."
25391,"PAM"," No!"
25393,"PAM"," I mean, it's either that or..."
25395,"PAM"," No! The solution to every problem isn't throwing frickin' acid on it!"
25398,"PAM"," I don't know. Maybe we could do something like one of those bait cars? But obviously, the car would be a vagina."
25409,"PAM"," But wait. If it's a kidnapping--"
25445,"PAM"," Because, you ding dong, our bait-car hooker has to be hotter than Lana."
25447,"PAM"," What? Did you suddenly go blind?"
25450,"PAM"," Yeah. So two grand apiece!"
25455,"PAM"," Probably."
25457,"PAM"," Really?"
25459,"PAM"," Damn."
25461,"PAM"," Really?"
25463,"PAM"," Probably because I got two frickin' hands!"
25468,"PAM"," Well, no news is good news."
25475,"PAM"," It wouldn't matter! Because Mr. Archer would feed you your own bones!"
25478,"PAM"," So come on! Let's pick a hooker!"
25483,"PAM"," Well, I was gonna say vagina."
25489,"PAM"," Ray's missing a hand."
25491,"PAM"," They're all gonna have--"
25493,"PAM"," Oh. Still, though..."
25495,"PAM"," Come on, it's New York. I bet it's 20,000 hookers here. What are the odds Mr. Archer already banged whichever one we pick?"
25497,"PAM"," Me too."
25502,"PAM"," Me too."
25504,"PAM"," Keep it up, Stumplestiltskin."
25543,"PAM"," Copy that, Figgis Newton."
25545,"PAM"," And also, shitty operation name."
25547,"PAM"," Why do you care? About either?"
25562,"PAM"," Sorry, I had to get stakeout supplies, and-- What happened to your van?"
25568,"PAM"," Okay, little help here, nerm-nerts."
25570,"PAM"," No. But I brought a couple joints."
25586,"PAM"," Oh, my God! This is, like, the perfect day."
25618,"PAM"," Oh, man, I don't want to sound greedy, but a threesome and then a break-up? Or a foursome, and I'm the pizza guy?"
25661,"PAM"," I mean, how do you not murder her every day?"
25693,"PAM"," Cyril's gotta... tell you something."
25713,"PAM"," Seriously. Maybe try growing a pair."
25795,"PAM"," Hand job."
25864,"PAM"," What?"
25874,"PAM"," What?"
26053,"PAM"," Seriously. Come on, Tinker Toy, let's go pound some homemade gin!"
26077,"PAM"," Okay I'm not. Jesus."
26089,"PAM"," Ooh, little ""handingo"" action."
26107,"PAM"," Wait, what?!"
26116,"PAM"," Well it's normally the other way around, but this time, I think I definitely prefer the carrot."
26118,"PAM"," Yeah... I know."
26125,"PAM"," That's racist!"
26142,"PAM"," I was voted best milker."
26171,"PAM"," Ooh, ""Yellow sub..."""
26208,"PAM"," Aw come on, they're not so..."
26225,"PAM"," What, like, butt-sex?"
26227,"PAM"," Well let's keep an open mind."
26327,"PAM"," Speak for yourself, holy shrink-snacks."
26329,"PAM"," So why are you messing around with this crazy shrink ray? It's not like you need a million bucks."
26331,"PAM"," I..."
26333,"PAM"," Why?"
26335,"PAM"," Well maybe she'll die."
26393,"PAM"," What the shit?"
26446,"PAM"," Ya know, on the farm it was actually a pot, like...it was literally a pot."
26491,"PAM"," Yeah... Should you even have those?"
26517,"PAM"," Well, cheer up, buddy. Maybe Krieger can get you some black bionic legs."
26540,"PAM"," Well, some people can't help it!"
26542,"PAM"," I was talking about Ray."
26578,"PAM"," Up there, to gawk at TV's Michael Gray."
26581,"PAM"," He can't come, he's crippled."
26610,"PAM"," What?"
26618,"PAM"," I was gonna ask you to."
26632,"PAM"," Yay!"
26634,"PAM"," Sorry."
26638,"PAM"," Who has an entire submarine with no damn talcum powder on board?"
26641,"PAM"," What's that mean?"
26643,"PAM"," Holy snacrophages."
26661,"PAM"," There's another one, nine o'clock!"
26677,"PAM"," Archer, look out!"
26683,"PAM"," Okay, door's closed! Hit it!"
26689,"PAM"," We could start drinking it."
26691,"PAM"," Well, plus I'm pretty thirsty."
26693,"PAM"," I'm pretty thirsty."
26707,"PAM"," Ah!"
26725,"PAM"," Mmkay."
26752,"PAM"," Woo-hoo!"
26810,"PAM"," And some kick-ass advertising."
26813,"PAM"," I gotta go get my car smogged!"
26895,"PAM"," Oh, man! Can't Cheryl do that? I wanted to be the gruff but lovable driver, mechanic, and maybe occasional muscle. Like a folksy B.A. Baracus."
26931,"PAM"," You know, you guys could help."
26978,"PAM"," What? His license?"
27075,"PAM"," Yay! [grunts]"
27077,"PAM"," Ow."
27104,"PAM"," [snickering] His name's Furlock Bones."
27159,"PAM"," And you have an erection."
27170,"PAM"," How do you know she's the real one?"
27178,"PAM"," Ew!"
27187,"PAM"," Is the bear, like, standing in the space or actually driving the car?"
27230,"PAM"," No-o-ope."
27242,"PAM"," Ooohh!"
27290,"PAM"," Aw, jeez, you guys are freaking me out! [*** Pam punches Cheryl ***]"
27305,"PAM"," Well, but you gotta hand it to him. This was the best voice-mail ever!"
27356,"PAM"," [GASPS]"
27359,"PAM"," Those are real-life crickets!"
27408,"PAM"," Oh, my tits, whaaat!"
27410,"PAM"," I'm not."
27416,"PAM"," Oh, my tits, whaaat!"
27442,"PAM"," Two hundred thousand divided by eight equal shares. That's Holy shitsnacks! 25 grand each?"
27620,"PAM"," Yeah, Cyril!"
27623,"PAM"," The free pass for havin' a vag."
27630,"PAM"," Wh-- She's obviously got a vagina."
27876,"PAM"," Her name's Cher--"
27963,"PAM"," Yeah, right! We're way over maximum voltage. I got about a buck-fifty in pennies crammed in the fusebox as it is."
27965,"PAM"," Oh, relax. Worst case, an innocent migrant farmhand goes to turn on the milking machine and gets electrocuted."
27967,"PAM"," I mean, worst case we fry some circuits."
27985,"PAM"," Don't try to body shame me! Dog Tits!"
28004,"PAM"," Oh right, I forgot about Miss Archer."
28033,"PAM"," [laughs] I knew that was coming. On my tits, what?"
28036,"PAM"," Noyce."
28038,"PAM"," No, that's a quote by Wilfrid Noyce."
28040,"PAM"," What? Yes!"
28042,"PAM"," Yes!"
28044,"PAM"," Noice."
28074,"PAM"," Wait, are we doing--"
28083,"PAM"," I found her!"
28086,"PAM"," Your mom! At least I think I did."
28096,"PAM"," Holy shitsnacks! And she's still alive, you guys! She lives in L. A. !"
28126,"PAM"," Oh, shit! The pennies!"
28136,"PAM"," Oh, you worry about everything."
28165,"PAM"," No, dummy!"
28186,"PAM"," And you want us to steal it!"
28193,"PAM"," Man, I'd rub it in his face!"
28195,"PAM"," I will stop, but I will not apologize."
28203,"PAM"," Holy shitsnacks! So we're going to a no-shit black-tie Hollywood gala?"
28205,"PAM"," But what do we wear? Is it, like, gowns and gloves? And do I rent a girdle? Are there gonna be dress fittings? Do I get a bikini wax? And I don't know my tiara size! And, oh, my God, what of shoes?"
28207,"PAM"," This is gonna be suckin' amazing!"
28209,"PAM"," And so, when I said ""suckin' amazing"" obviously I meant ""suckin' bullshit. """
28215,"PAM"," Really?"
28222,"PAM"," You, Otto Von Jizmarck."
28224,"PAM"," Eh"
28228,"PAM"," Wouldn't you like to"
28230,"PAM"," This is a deconstructed slider made from certified Kobe beef from Hyogo prefecture, with a tarragon aioli."
28240,"PAM"," Really? Some bullshit job."
28254,"PAM"," Oh, you're way prettier than her."
28257,"PAM"," Shut up!"
28272,"PAM"," Aw, leave him alone. He's not the one trying to shuck your lady-corn."
28274,"PAM"," How should I know?"
28276,"PAM"," I'm also supposed to be pooling tips. Which I haven't gotten any yet, so Hey, Ray! You getting any tips?"
28280,"PAM"," Okay, so, I've been watching like a hawk, and here's the whats Lana's pissed at Archer 'cause she thought he was macking on Bleached Asshole, and she's pissed at Archer 'cause she thought he was a Hollywood honcho like ol' Whitey Crane over there, who is macking on Lana, who's totally full of crap 'cause deep down, she's totally buyin' into Whitey's bullshit. So to get back at her, Archer's gonna pretend to mack on, but not really, 'cause deep down, he's got a real-life crush-boner for her, Veronica Deane!"
28282,"PAM"," Well, ""whom,"" but yeah."
28284,"PAM"," I don't know who she's into."
28288,"PAM"," Anyway, I don't want to jinx it, but this might end up a murder mystery."
28295,"PAM"," Why do we have to clean it up? Her dumb ass broke the damn thing."
28407,"PAM"," There he is. How you doing, bub?"
28410,"PAM"," Well, for starters, you're a one-hitter quitter."
28412,"PAM"," Hm, like five hours?"
28415,"PAM"," Which"
28418,"PAM"," And these guys are losing their shit."
28420,"PAM"," Don't start."
28422,"PAM"," And so about a jillion cops showed up, so then it was a full-on siege. And then after that, the head clown"
28426,"PAM"," Well, except for kinda the core group."
28429,"PAM"," Sorry, that was my jam."
28434,"PAM"," Wh That is the least best part."
28436,"PAM"," So Cheryl here I'm sorry. Tania here has decided she's got Stockholm Syndrome."
28458,"PAM"," Come on!"
28468,"PAM"," When this is over, remind me to kick your tits off."
28548,"PAM"," Hmm? Infiltrated the enemy, huh?"
28550,"PAM"," Enema! Just talking about enemas, and, uh, how clean and fresh they make you feel. I mean, not you, per se, but people, ya know, in general, I guess. And kids, also, maybe. I don't know what kids are into these days. Are whippits still a thing? Point is shitter's clogged!"
28564,"PAM"," Hang on. I got a big old wad of toilet paper stuck on my shoe."
28574,"PAM"," Well hope I'm not allergic to clown blood. S'up, ding-dong?"
28576,"PAM"," I heard you were getting your ass beat."
28606,"PAM"," Welp. Stay cold, Pony Boy. Eh Okay, now I just gotta find Archer."
28625,"PAM"," But first I gotta figure out which one of these scrote-licks is him."
28639,"PAM"," Oh, and bigger question-- how the hell am I gonna tell which clown is Archer? You didn't think about that, did ya, Poovey?"
28667,"PAM"," Holy shit-house! That must be Archer and a bad guy! But which is which? Should I shoot one wait or both? Just blow off everybody's kneecaps and then apologize to one of 'em? Wait, what am I saying? All the other bad guys will hear the shotgun! Well Aw, damn it! Holy shitsnacks!"
28670,"PAM"," Archer?"
28674,"PAM"," Goddamn it!"
28676,"PAM"," Us?"
28681,"PAM"," Oh, my God! Seriously? I wish I'd blown off both of you guys's kneecaps."
28684,"PAM"," Oh, eat my asshole! Now what are we gonna do about the hostage situation?"
28714,"PAM"," How the hell is that a toy for kids?"
28716,"PAM"," Oh, thank God,"
28765,"PAM"," Sharknoid, Sharknoid 2, Sharknoid 3 In 3-D, Sharknoid 4, Shark"
28767,"PAM"," Let me finish. Sharknoid Five."
28813,"PAM"," Aw, man. Lousy timing. My bush looks like I'm sitting on Jerry Garcia's face."
28816,"PAM"," And he tells two friends."
28818,"PAM"," And so on and so on and so on."
28823,"PAM"," Who says she's pimping you?"
28827,"PAM"," And-or kakow?"
28829,"PAM"," Uh, wha"
28841,"PAM"," Oh, please."
28848,"PAM"," Welp, guess I'm gonna need a bucket of ice and a roll of gaffer tape."
28850,"PAM"," D-I-Y Brazilian. When it's this bushy, the clippers just get stoved up."
28853,"PAM"," Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know I was going to get called up to the big show."
28882,"PAM"," Only if Zissner's into archeology."
28888,"PAM"," Oh, man. I'm gonna seduce the dick off that dude. Oww!"
28890,"PAM"," Exactly. Ow!"
28899,"PAM"," Oh, man."
28939,"PAM"," Well, a lot of it's the Brazilian. They really make you feel sexy. At least until the ingrown hairs turn me back into Bumplestiltskin."
28970,"PAM"," Um Psst. Lana, come here. Come here, come here, come here, come here. Take the bet. Double it."
28972,"PAM"," Don't be shitty. I'm in progress. And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this."
28974,"PAM"," Right?"
28976,"PAM"," Yes, it does. We just need to mix it with some mole's blood."
29008,"PAM"," Okay, let's go put some stank on it."
29010,"PAM"," Unless we can find some mole's blood."
29029,"PAM"," Yeah, me too. Pony up, neckbone."
29042,"PAM"," Then why's Krieger dressed up like Evil Nazi Bob Ross Knievel?"
29044,"PAM"," It's for work!"
29059,"PAM"," Wait."
29077,"PAM"," And tape it."
29085,"PAM"," Goddamn, I wish I was married!"
29097,"PAM"," Aah!"
29101,"PAM"," Enter Sandman."
29127,"PAM"," Really?"
29204,"PAM"," No, but for real, though, the CIA really drugged and hypnotized people?"
29213,"PAM"," Oh, you can't!"
29215,"PAM"," Or your goddamn brain chips, like you made that rabbit a vegetable with."
29221,"PAM"," Dude, is that blackface?"
29223,"PAM"," Whoa!"
29229,"PAM"," Wait, what?"
29281,"PAM"," What? Bluntz & Blintzen? Nice try, Krieger. Who am I, the Road Runner? Although if this is for real, I'll never forgive myself. Goddamn it, this better not be a ruse! All right. There better be some damn [sputters, spits] What the [heart beating] Huh."
29283,"PAM"," Yes, Doctor."
29285,"PAM"," Yes, Doctor."
29287,"PAM"," Hey, neck-bird, come here a second!"
29289,"PAM"," Uh, there's a mouse caught in a trap, and he's still alive, but his tiny little back's broken!"
29294,"PAM"," Hey, Cyril, come here!"
29297,"PAM"," Uh, we found Lana's diary!"
29300,"PAM"," Yes, Doctor."
29401,"PAM"," Yes, Ray."
29463,"PAM"," [exhales] Pants, hell. Where's that damn cat?"
29465,"PAM"," The one that shit in my mouth. [spitting] And that may or may not be a metaphor."
29472,"PAM"," So now we gotta go see Jo Jo Dancer."

29560,"PAM"," Because that crazy dago let me drive the truck, so I was the road head-ee."
29562,"PAM"," Yep. Just one of the many perks of having a C. D. L."
29564,"PAM"," Commercial driver's license. And also a [bleep]."
29566,"PAM"," [chuckling] That's what he said. But in Italian."
29572,"PAM"," Uh, just you?"
29579,"PAM"," Must be her cheat day."
29627,"PAM"," What the hell, Tunt? You leave me to craft all the service by myself?"
29636,"PAM"," Nah, somebody definitely tampered with it. The brake line's cut, the steering wheel's tied off, and the throttle linkage is jammed wide open."
29663,"PAM"," [chuckles] Which hole?"
29666,"PAM"," [laughing] Which hole? [clears throat] Sorry. What?"
29668,"PAM"," Like, is he good at plowing?"
29671,"PAM"," Aww, Li'l Baby Elton"
29675,"PAM"," Yeah, you don't forget a hoof to the tits. Or shooting your first mule."
29677,"PAM"," Hmm two."
29686,"PAM"," So you want us to quit doing our jobs to help you cockblock Archer?"
